  This feature works only when developers make use of either Alchemy or Infura providers. It cannot be enabled with the public provider as our mission is to ensure stability and not introduce a risk of rate-limited storefronts.

Since the packages support ESM, some frameworks (Next.js) will try to transpile the packages and use a CommonJS version of styled-components we needed to re-export styled-components with a .default key for CJS support.

- [#47](https://github.com/Shopify/blockchain-components/pull/47) [`29184fb`](https://github.com/Shopify/blockchain-components/commit/29184fbf7a1f938aa7cd3678777c0a2b29588056) Thanks [@QuintonC](https://github.com/QuintonC)! - Removes redux-logger to address an ESM based-packed issue with webpack bundlers.
