### Patch Changes

- [#72](https://github.com/Shopify/blockchain-components/pull/72) [`c69d654`](https://github.com/Shopify/blockchain-components/commit/c69d654fd46d72ee53c8775dc254d3888670aaed) Thanks [@QuintonC](https://github.com/QuintonC)! - Removes internal packages (shared + tsconfig) from package.json

Since the packages support ESM, some frameworks (Next.js) will try to transpile the packages and use a CommonJS version of styled-components we needed to re-export styled-components with a .default key for CJS support.

- [#31](https://github.com/Shopify/blockchain-components/pull/31) [`c75ce7e`](https://github.com/Shopify/blockchain-components/commit/c75ce7eb002a1eec43cd5939eebd75d749e0f4d8) Thanks [@QuintonC](https://github.com/QuintonC)! - Addresses an issue where types that are used from the internal shared package were not compiled and exported as expected. This resulted in an issue where providing a theme to any of the providers would result in a type mismatch, but also made it impossible to extend or inherit any of the default themes.
